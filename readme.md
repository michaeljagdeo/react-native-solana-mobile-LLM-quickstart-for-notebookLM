## üí° Pro Tips for NotebookLM Usage

### Best Practices
1. **Upload all 50 files at once** - NotebookLM works best with complete context
2. **Ask specific questions** - "Show me code for X" works better than "Tell me about X"
3. **Reference file numbers** - "Based on file 04, how do I implement wallet auth?"
4. **Request code examples** - Always ask for working code snippets
5. **Follow security guidelines** - The Constitution (file 01) ensures secure practices

### Example Developer Queries
```
"Using the Mobile Wallet Adapter patterns from file 04, show me how to connect 
to a Solana wallet in React Native with proper error handling"

"Based on the tutorials in file 08, create a complete NFT minting component 
that follows the security practices from file 01"

"Show me the complete transaction flow from files 05 and 16, including 
TypeScript types and error handling"
```
